# mobile weatherstation project

The goal of this project is to build a weatherstation, that can be
transported to events, like Chaos Communication Camp, or whatever
the successor to MCH2022 will be called.

As of March 2023, this is still in its early stages, and far
from finished. More info might be in the docs directory.
